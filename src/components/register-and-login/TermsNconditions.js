        conditions that govern your access to and use of the Services (as
        defined below) and is an agreement between Rx One Care Private Limited
        (also referred to as “RXONE,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and you or the
        entity you represent (“you” or “your”). This Agreement takes effect when
        you click an “I Accept” button or check box presented with these terms
        or, if earlier, when you use any of the Services (the “Effective Date”).
        You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts
        (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into this Agreement for
        an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that
        you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 12 for
        definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement.

        <br/>
        <p>
        <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}> 3.1 Service Fees.</span>
        We calculate and bill fees and charges monthly. We may bill you more
        frequently for fees accrued if we suspect that your account is
        fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. You will pay us the applicable
        fees and charges for use of the Services as subscribed using the account
        details mentioned in your invoice using one of the payment methods we
        support. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to
        us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or
        withholding. Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a
        Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the
        RXONE Site, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may
        increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services you are
        using by giving you at least 30 days’ prior notice. We may elect to
        charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate
        permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.</p>
     <p>
        <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>3.2 Taxes. </span>
        (a) Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law,
        for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and
        charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that
        are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and
        payments under this Agreement. All fees payable by you are exclusive of
        Indirect Taxes, except where applicable law requires otherwise. We may
        charge and you will pay applicable Indirect Taxes that we are legally
        obligated or authorized to collect from you. You will provide such
        information to us as reasonably required to determine whether we are
        obligated to collect Indirect Taxes from you. We will not collect, and
        you will not pay, any Indirect Tax for which you furnish us a properly
        completed exemption certificate or a direct payment permit certificate
        for which we can claim an available exemption from such Indirect Tax.
        All payments made by you to us under this Agreement will be made free
        and clear of any deduction or withholding, as required by law. If any
        such deduction or withholding (including cross-border withholding taxes)
        is required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as are
        necessary so that the net amount received by us is equal to the amount
        then due and payable under this Agreement. We will provide you with such
        tax forms as are reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate
        the amount of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of
        payments made under this Agreement. We will invoice you from our
        registered office at the address of your establishment (as registered
        with the tax authorities, if applicable) receiving the Services in
        accordance with the applicable tax laws. All fees and charges payable
        under this Agreement will be exclusive of applicable national, state or
        local indirect taxes ("Taxes") that RXONE India is legally obligated to
        charge under Indian tax laws. For the purpose of this clause, local
        indirect taxes include Goods and Services Tax (“GST”), which includes
        the Central Goods and Services Tax ("Central Tax"), the State Goods and
        Services Tax ("State Tax"), the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax
        ("UT Tax"), the Integrated Goods and Services Tax ("Integrated Tax") as
        may be applicable. The Taxes charged by RXONE CARE PVT LTD, India will
        be stated in the invoice pursuant to applicable laws. RXONE India may
        charge and you will pay any applicable Taxes, which are stated
        separately on the invoice. As per the statutory requirement under GST,
        you will provide all necessary information such as the correct GST
        registered address, legal name and GSTIN ("GST Information") in order
        for RXONE India to issue correct GST invoices as per the applicable
        legal requirements. In the event, the GST invoice is incorrect, you will
        inform us in a timely manner, to enable RXONE India to correct the GST
        tax invoice. RXONE India will determine the place of supply for the
        Services based on the GST Information provided by you and accordingly,
        charge GST (CGST and SGST/UTGST or IGST) on its invoice. Any withholding
        taxes that may be applicable to the fees and charges payable to us are
        for our account. You will pay the fees and charges in our invoice in
        full (gross) without applying any withholding taxes. If you separately
        deposit applicable withholding taxes on such fees and charges to the
        applicable government treasury and issue us a withholding tax
        certificate evidencing such deposit, following receipt of the
        withholding tax certificate in original form, we will reimburse to you
        an amount equal to the taxes that are evidenced as deposited.
